## **4. Challenges and Ethical Considerations**
Transitioning toward *AI Political Supremacy* will face resistance, mainly from **traditional power structures, corporations, and ideological purists**. Key challenges include:

- **Ethical Concerns:** How can AI ensure fairness without human empathy?
